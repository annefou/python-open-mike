### Room: TEO-H1 1.217, time: 16:00 - 17:30

I know there was the wish to discuss functional programming but we changed our mind
to this time discuss web APIs since we believe this makes for more fun exercises.
But you are most welcome to implement them in a functional way (study immutable data
structures, and the functions `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`).


## Exercises
